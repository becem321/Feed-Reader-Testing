 # Feed Reader Testing

## Description

* The feed Reader Testing Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree using an open source testing framework for JavaScript called jasmine. where i am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application has incomplete Jasmine test suites, and I write the remaining test suites and get them to pass. The goal is to learn about JavaScript testing, which is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development".
